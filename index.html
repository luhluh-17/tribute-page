                    Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 - c. October 12, 2011) was an American computer
                    scientist.
                    He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson,
                    the Unix operating system and B programming language.
                    Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983,
                    the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal
                    of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999.
                    Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department
                    when he retired in 2007.

            <h3>notablebiographies.com</h3>
            <p>Unix was written in machine language, which had a small vocabulary and did not deal well with multiple
                computers and their memories. So Ritchie combined some aspects of the older systems with aspects of the
                new one, and came up with the "C" programming language. In the early twenty-first century, "C" is still
                the dominant language of computer programming. It was such a simple, concise language that almost every
                single computer maker at the time switched to it.
                "C" uses very little syntax and few instructions, but it is extremely structured and modular. Because of
                this it was easy to use in different computers. There were large blocks of "C" functions that were
                already written that programmers could copy whole into their own programs without having to start from
                scratch, making it faster and easier to implement. These blocks were easily accessible, available in
                libraries so programmers could access them. By the middle of the 1980s "C" had become one of the most
                popular programming languages in the world. Because of the speed with which "C" could be used to write
                programs and run them, companies began using "C" to develop their own software.</p>

            <h1>Dennis Ritchie: The Shoulders Steve Jobs Stood On</h1>
            <h3>wired.com</h3>
            <p>THE TRIBUTES TO Dennis Ritchie wont match the river of praise that spilled out over the web after the
                death of Steve Jobs. But they should.

                And then some.

                "When Steve Jobs died last week, there was a huge outcry, and that was very moving and justified. But
                Dennis had a bigger effect, and the public doesn't even know who he is," says Rob Pike, the programming
                legend and current Googler who spent 20 years working across the hall from Ritchie at the famed Bell
                Labs.

                On Wednesday evening, with a post to Google+, Pike announced that Ritchie had died at his home in New
                Jersey over the weekend after a long illness, and though the response from hardcore techies was immense,
                the collective eulogy from the web at large doesn't quite do justice to Ritchie's sweeping influence on
                the modern world. Dennis Ritchie is the father of the C programming language, and with fellow Bell Labs
                researcher Ken Thompson, he used C to build UNIX, the operating system that so much of the world is
                built on -- including the Apple empire overseen by Steve Jobs.

                “Pretty much everything on the web uses those two things: C and UNIX,” Pike tells Wired. “The browsers
                are written in C. The UNIX kernel -- that pretty much the entire Internet runs on -- is written in C.
                Web servers are written in C, and if they're not, they're written in Java or C++, which are C
                derivatives, or Python or Ruby, which are implemented in C. And all of the network hardware running
                these programs I can almost guarantee were written in C.

                “It's really hard to overstate how much of the modern information economy is built on the work Dennis
                did.”

                Even Windows was once written in C, he adds, and UNIX underpins both Mac OS X, Apple's desktop operating
                system, and iOS, which runs the iPhone and the iPad. "Jobs was the king of the visible, and Ritchie is
                the king of what is largely invisible," says Martin Rinard, professor of electrical engineering and
                computer science at MIT and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

                "Jobs' genius is that he builds these products that people really like to use because he has taste and
                can build things that people really find compelling. Ritchie built things that technologists were able
                to use to build core infrastructure that people don't necessarily see much anymore, but they use
                everyday."

                From B to C

                Dennis Ritchie built C because he and Ken Thompson needed a better way to build UNIX. The original UNIX
                kernel was written in assembly language, but they soon decided they needed a “higher level” language,
                something that would give them more control over all the data that spanned the OS. Around 1970, they
                tried building a second version with Fortran, but this didn't quite cut it, and Ritchie proposed a new
                language based on a Thompson creation known as B.</p>
